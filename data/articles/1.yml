  First-time users of [astronaut.io](http://astronaut.io) can easily find their minds overwhelmed. Bombarded by five-second clips of music-making, monologues in foreign languages, shaky recordings of local football games. One is quickly compelled to pause. Think for a moment. Perhaps even click on a link, stumbling down a digital rabbit-hole as an invisible intruder looking in at the personal life of another. It is a brief yet humbling reminder of the scale of the internet, and our own tiny part in its existence.

  Among the many phrases that surf the wave of Internet trends is a quote labelling our generation as ‘the middle children of history. Born too late to explore the earth, born too early to explore space’. I’d argue against the pessimism and say that we are born just in time to explore the internet. YouTube and I share a similar birthday, as we both look forward to celebrating our 20 th ’s next year (2025). Yet YouTube has a few more memories than me - around [1.4 billion](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/01/how-many-videos-youtube-research/677250/) more.

  If YouTube’s claim that 300 hours of watch-time are uploaded every minute is true (likely it is) then I hate to break the news, but you probably can’t watch all of it.

  But we can try. A hobby I’ve taken up recently is chaining-watching videos with low view counts, to see what random people are up to. I swear I’m not creepy. I recommend giving it a try sometime and seeing what you stumble across. This hobby was in turn inspired myself stumbling upon an exhibition at Tate Modern in London, in January of 2023, where I viewed the multimodal artwork [Dance to the End of Love](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/zaatari-dance-to-the-end-of-love-t14276) by Lebanese filmmaker [Akram Zaatari](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/akram-zaatari-11598). It involves four oscillating screens of Arabic men playing guitar, dangerously riding motorcycles, and professions of homosexual love. What struck me the most was the sheer number of said videos. A powerful exhibition on how a niche corner of [internet uploaders express themselves](https://vimeo.com/19581172).

  There’s a shared humanity behind creating content for the internet. Creating has always been part of human consciousness. The desire to project oneself can be satisfied by posting a video to YouTube. In doing so, one sends out a message-in-a-bottle into a vast ocean of digital content, in hopes that one may be picked up briefly by a passer-through of this aether.

  People want to be heard. They want to be seen. This blog post is yet another example of that. You probably engage in this more than you think. Indulging in short-form social media content has sprung haphazardly into the schedules of all; doomscrolling has entered the modern lingo, and day-to-day we catch ourselves uttering the embarrassing remark “I saw this TikTok which said…”.

  Admitting to doomscrolling is humbling. Nevertheless, algorithms are only getting more finetuned, and if mindlessly scrolling reels is a pastime now, it will only be more-so in the future. The digital age is now. The allegorical cave has been exited three swipes ago. Its fascinating to think how media technology will shape the daily habits and psychology of humans in years to come.

  I’d been making YouTube videos for about seven years now. Why I started is the same reason anyone else does – a desire to be seen. I’ve still left up all my old videos. To me they function as a wonderful digital diary into my past self.

  And I wonder - one hundred years down the track, or even a thousand – will some nineteen-year-old adolescent click on the right series of hyperlinks which will bring up one of my own videos? Food for thought.
